# FileManager
A file management system is a computer program which provides a user with an interface to manage files and folders. When we observed that some of the file management systems were large in data size and some of them were too much complicated to use. To deal with the problem of large data size the development team did the following -  1.Chose light platform(programing language)  2. Design an algorithm whose data size is smaller.   In order to find a light platform, the team took the help of the internet we looked through different languages and finally decided to use java as it provided needed sophistication and was lighter than others. And we decided to include only a few necessary features. It includes copy, sorting of files, deleting of files and searching a particular file and a login to ensure privacy and security for the user . To ensure that our system was able to meet the user requirements we performed testing of our system by both “Black box testing” and “White box testing”.   For providing an easier user interface we utilised  “JAVA Swing”. Our file manager provides a better response time.It is simple to operate so even people with less experience can easily use it and it’s advertisement free providing a better user experience. It’s safer as compared some other file explorers or file managers .As compared  to other file management systems it has a clearer and  a better aesthetic look.It’s compatible for windows which provides us large user base.
